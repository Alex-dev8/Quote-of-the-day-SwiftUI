# Quote-of-the-day-SwiftUI
This app made using SwiftUI is an example of what can be done by parsing a JSON file containing some quotes, authors and images.
There are 2 views, the main view which loops over the json objects, which produce images and text which can be tapped by the user to go into a second view, with a larger image and text. A simple template which you can use for your own app.
